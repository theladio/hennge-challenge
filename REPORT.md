# Report for HENNGE
So, first off; you will notice that we have not provided a mockup for `Mission 2`.
This is simply because it takes less time and gives a `look and feel` by simply producing `Mission 2` directly as a prototype in code.

This is often how we work since we save time if a feature is implemented (since the code is already done) and also gives users a more realistic feeling of the feature instead of just looking at a dead, flat mockup.

In other words, you will see `Mission 2` already ready and done in code when you startup the project.

## Wait a second... "we"?
**Yes, *we***! If you look at our resume (it should have been part of the application, but just in case it's also included in the repository as [`resume.pdf`](./resume.pdf)), you will notice that we are 2 developers from Sweden looking for work abroad. We are both looking for work and thought that showing of our skills as a small team that works really good together, **for the cost of 1 developer**, would give us a better chance of working abroad.

We really want to try out other cultures and are really fascinated by Japan, so we want to do our best to impress you with what we can do. We are also **open to relocate** when the current state of the world is back to some sense of normality.

Now that we have that explained and out of the way, lets talk about how we worked!

### Why webpack and React?
Simply because we can make a scaleable, simple application with very little work. This is by far the easiest way of getting stuff done really fast. Sure, we could do it all vanilla style but that would create less flexibility and possibilities instead of having a complete web-application with no boundaries.

### How did you approach the issue?
First off, we looked at the `frontend_resources.zip` and did a quick inventory of what components we might need and how we should structure our repository with assets, structure etc.

After that, we had to make sure we got a working environment before jumping into the fun stuff *aka* "the code".

From here, we just split the work and produced component after component. You won't see any pull-requests in the repository, but we verified each others code and came up with suggestions and double checking that we got working code in each commit. If this was regular work for us, we would of course create pull-requests, write feedback and get everything done the right way.

When we felt kind of done with `Mission 1`, we started to look at how much work we need to do without overengineering this admission challenge. We added a working sort-function and stopped when it comes to showing correct emails depending on the date-picker values.

As we said before, we also added `Mission 2` directly in the code after this so the application also has a body-view function for each email.

### So why did you not build a real date-picker!?
Because we wanted the data to come from a `json`, just like a server-response probably would, and we did not want to go too far by creating a backend-service as well for providing more "real" data. So by sticking to our `json`-data with static data, we could also simulate the actual view that we had in the mockup when it comes to how dates are shown.

A correct date-picker would require you to pick exact dates according to the mockup and also would not have the different display options for our email-dates (since i.e. *0:20* would be more like *2020/01/02* since it would not be an email from *today*)

### Was this a good admission challenge?
Definitely! This is also how we like to work and are very familiar with this type of work *(mockup -> HTML)*.

### Any last words?
Well, we could have made some of the components even smaller and easier to look at but we also feel like we already might have overthinked some parts since this is after all just a "simple mockup translated to HTML" and there is always room for improvement.

We feel that no matter what we work on, we are never done. There is no such thing as a perfect project 100% done, so we could improve this code over and over again.

We really hope to hear from you and wish you the best during these times. Stay safe!
