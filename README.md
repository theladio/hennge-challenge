# HENNGE Admission Challenge

### Development
How do I start this you might ask? Well, it's simple!
Just run `npm i && npm run start` in the root of the project and project is should be running on http://localhost:8080!

### Production
If you want a production-build of the project, just run `npm run build` instead.
This will create a `dist`-folder with everything you need for deploying it!

Have fun!
